# Bol.com | Retourkansjes
Small tool that checks bol.com for "Send back" deals *(Retourkansjes)*.

The tool connects to the web server REST API to get product details, the request only requires a product ID to keep track of items, no special headers or authentication was required.
My main goal here was to find out when the latest Apple Watch series 5 is on a hot sale, since they rarely get send back.

When a Send Back deal is found at one of the listed item id's, my bot will notify me by send a message on discord using a discord webhook.
